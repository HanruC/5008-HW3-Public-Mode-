# Homework 03 - Stacks and Queues -

Name:Hanru Chen

Github Account name:HanruC  

How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 20 hours to 24 hours. 

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
- one per row, add more if needed 
I learned and check all resources by my own. 


Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
- one row per resource
GeeksforGeeks
Stackoverflow
w3schools.com
c programming book


(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 

## Further Thinking Questions

1. Circular queues are used quite a bit in operating systems and high performance systems, especially when performance matters. Do a little outside research, and answer this question specifically: Why is a ring buffer useful and/or when should it be used? 
2. We are going to talk about stacks quite a lot in this course, so it will be important to understand them. Do a little outside research, and edit this section of the readme answering specifically: Why is a stack useful and/or when should it be used?

1. basically, circular queues are used in when i tried to do the dequeue in the myqueue.h . Basically it tells us that we have reached
to the end. Using circular queues can prevent us to exceed the capacity. Also, it allows an efficient memory access. And the time is O(1). 

2. First stack structure is fast in run time which is O(1). This time can be in both push and pop. Stack in problem solving area can be
powerful. Stacks are useful for doing the backtracking since it is LIFO structure. 


For each of these questions, we are expecting your answer to be in the range of 2-3 paragraphs (can include complexity, example usage, pros/cons, etc). Make sure to cite your sources. It is recommended you use [IEEE citation style](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/ieee_style/ieee_overview.htm) as it is most common for CS papers and research. 


## Important notes

* Your code **must compile and run** on the Khoury machines to earn credit. Make sure you test your programs on these machines, as this is where we grade your assignments.
* You must commit any additional files(if any) into your repository so we can test your code.
  * Points will be lost if you forget!
* Do not forget, once you have pushed your changes to your repo make sure that you **submit them to Gradescope before the assignment deadline!**
